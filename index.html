<p><strong>Isabel Romero-Avila</strong></p>
<p>Class of 2026</p>
<p>Intended computer science major</p>
<p>I am taking this course because I'm interested in computer science. I'm also interested in understanding how the technology we use everyday works on the backend so that I understand how the smallest details (like headers and hyperlinks) are created.</p>
<p>I have zero experience with creating content for the web, but I have learned python through programming and am currently learning Java.</p>
<p>My goal in this course is to be able to learn new ways of programming and gain the ability to work on websites so maybe one day I could create my own website for myself.</p>

    <p><strong>Data Basics</strong></p>
    <p>The tutorial I selected was data basics. 
        It discusses how information is stored on computers and relates it to a switch being turned on and off. 
        Code is measured in bits and bytes and the biggest measurement I recall is that 8 bits equal one byte. 
        We use binary when talking about code because it can either be "on" or "off". 
        I also learned that character encoding is when computers store/represent text by assinging numbers to characters.
        So, when there are images saved on a computer, they are encoded using binary in order for them to be saved in a file and for the computer to render the image properly (with the correct color, size, etc)</p>

<ul><strong>3 web-based projects that represent my interests:</strong>
    <li><a href="https://www.thewikigame.com/">The Wiki Game</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/rock-paper-scissors.html">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/">How Bad Is Your Spotify?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think the three web-based projects all represent my goal of wanting to make websites for entertainment. I love the idea of making websites where people can play a game or interact with AI, and just spend time in a wholesome way. Growing up, I loved playing games on websites like Roblox, Y8 games, and more. I have even used the Wiki Game when I was bored, so being able to create a website with a similar purpose would be a big accomplishment of mine. </p>

<!--I found a bit of difficulty starting this project because I've never used Github before so I didn't know how to fork and clone the code, but I found a Youtube video that helped.-->
